# hello-world
This is my entrence to coding
i am a web surfer, and i`am staying at home because of the corona virus.
i thought i should use the time to learn coding, so i started googling stuff like `learn c++...` untill i found github i`m really liking this whole place.
i`m 30 years old male from north Africa some shitty country called Algeria wich is my home.
i just started now at 5 05PM in march 23 2020, lets see where i`m gonna get with this.
